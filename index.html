              and Use the bootstrap grid system to capture page outline, <br />I
              applied the method, According to the criteria, <br />I set the

              I divided the header, main, footer, and section by HTML element
              and made it by structure.<br />
              For CSS, I set the default settings, global variables, I styled it
              through CSS according to the HTML element.<br />
              Several interactions were handled in JavaScript.<br />
              Implementation of specific functional behavior, styling changes

              Besides that, I learned how to version and deploy projects with

              <h4>1. Learn about functional ideas and information</h4>
              <p>
                What I felt while making the portfolio pages is, first of all,
                the portfolio is about me It's about introducing what I can do
                and what I've done I think the purpose is to include it.<br />
                Briefly, explain the work piece, link it up. Portfolio is an
                example I made it by referring to the sample, but in fact, I
                worked hard on lectures and cloning I made it for the purpose of
                listening and mastering functional implementation. <br />Add a
                mixture Add the function, and if you add weight, it will be more
                mine, but for me, it is not yet I don't have much time, so I'll
                add a function later I'm going to implement it. <br />My works
                are one-page, Or I implemented a layout that puts the top menu.
                It's just his work If I write it down and link it up, it looks a
                bit empty, more functionally I thought about what to implement,
                and <br />
                my content There is a web page, and users can access the site
                for information When you visit, you put in keywords and search,
                so that you can search well I thought that seo work was
                necessary to aim for exposure. Namely, It's a technology called
                search engine optimization that helps you collect well in search
                engine bots When users see my content, they can filter it with
                keywords I wanted to put in that functional aspect, and the meta
                tag work Did.<br />
                Usually at work, the planner does the planning stage, and even
                the screen composition It is said to make a draft. That is, you
                separate pages, and you press this A pop-up like this pops up,
                and if you press this, it moves like this. It defines everything
                I mean, I do. There's a prototype tool that helps you do that
                do. <br />Then designers can design based on the design do. It
                is better to refer to various references for design.<br />
                I also try to be a planner and designer and refer to various
                references It was necessary. What I'm going to make is, I'm
                going to make a different content on my way to Portfolio I also
                want to provide it, so I want to refer to other blogs for
                reference Collect data with parts. <br />
                When designing, the overall I decided on a concept or branding
                that would be the base, and it's called ux, From the user's
                point of view, they try to provide experienced services, (it
                seems difficult) I heard that you use a lot of work tools such
                as sketches, Adobe xd, and pygma, Images are said to use
                Photoshop, Ilar, etc.<br />
                I don't know about that in detail, but the font on the menu I'll
                use this, give color, and make this and that simple and clean I
                was going to give it to you. So, the results that designers put
                out are images It's a draft file, and based on that, I mark up
                html.
              </p>

              <h4>2. Design & Markup</h4>
              <p>
                So I marked up HTML. That is, the menu above is nav. This is a
                list Ulli, this is a link. A, button. To match each function I
                made an element.<br />
                After html markup, css work is done to style it. font Color,
                size, spacing, etc. were defined in the HTML document Bring up
                the stylesheet and see if it's rendered in the browser could.
                <br />
                But, more dynamically, when the user presses it, it pops out, If
                you scroll down, it goes back and forth. To give a dynamic
                effect You have to write JavaScript.<br />
                It is said that up to this part, a professional group called Web
                Publisher worked. Web standards, I need to work on different
                OSs, and I need to work on the responsive type It is said that
                web publishing is to consider and cover this part.<br />
                Front-end development is simply called login processing, that
                is, when you are logged in, this is what happens I'll show you
                the screen, and if I'm not logged in, I'll show you this I mark
                up the pages according to the number of cases It is a task that
                moves dynamically according to the situation.<br />
                So far, planners, designers, and developers are in a conference
                together They attend and have meetings to see if they can be
                technically implemented by developers, The developer sets a
                technology stack based on it, that is, a language Decide which
                one to use, framework, library to use. To where I need to study
                what kind of DB you need, and I need to study it separately I
                use this and that, and I have to study the new technology, When
                working with an external server, server setting and DB setting
                are required, It is said that it is a part that needs to be set
                up in advance.<br />
                In other words, the developer has a plan with detailed
                functions, markup results, etc I received the draft file and set
                it up so that I can start developing it right away This is
                because I can meet the schedule without a hitch.<br />
                Anyway, I haven't done a lot of design and mark-up work, I
                thought I should work on it using bootstrap. (Later on) I also
                wrote something called Ant design. (Because of the react.)
                <br />
                The bootstrap is an open source made on Twitter, and it can be
                used a lot on the web The components and layouts are all made
                up.<br />
                HTML, css, js. I made all these files, and if you have a design
                that you want to use If you have a layout, you can use it while
                looking at the usage.<br />
                So there are some works that are made by applying the layout
                using bootstrap, The reason I used bootstrap is because the
                reaction type is set up in advance Because I have it, I want to
                make it easily.<br />
                There are so many different devices these days, so the style
                changes depending on the resolution It's set up so that you can
                easily implement the css work, that is, the reactive type For
                the first project, I'am going to use only the grid system layout
                I saw it and did it.<br />
                I added class names and focused on that. But it's up to your
                taste If you rip it off and fix it, there are times when you
                have to be done manually There were a lot. Since it was my first
                time, I repeated it a little bit and it took a long time It was
                a task, but I think it will speed up if I master it.
              </p>

              <h4>3. Front end part</h4>
              <p>
                So the result of HTML, css, the main screen, the list screen,
                the detailed screen, It consists of a manager, 404 pages, etc.
                <br />
                First, if you have index. html and list. html, then usually
                index. html is The first screen that users see when they first
                access the homepage It's a page.<br />
                And if you search here, or if you click on a tag like this, I'm
                going to the page where I'm distributing content that fits the
                tag I called this a list page.<br />
                <br />
                *Fixed html document page and dynamic page><br /><br />
                If the user is actually on the bulletin board when using it in
                real life, the click is not clear It needs to come out, and the
                results need to match, too.<br />
                I don't know in advance how many I'm going to get, so if the
                user writes on the bulletin board Does it have to come out as
                much as the writing. <br />You might not have one There are so
                many that you might need to move on to the next button, that is,
                situations The content of this Web document changes all the
                time.<br />
                So this web document is not only a fixed HTML file, but it's
                also a dynamic file every time It can be made.<br />
                In other words, if you put in a keyword, you can develop it so
                that you can spread the appropriate data And then, finally, this
                document will be made again In other words, you can create a web
                document that matches the keywords you put in The program code
                is working somewhere.<br />
                If the program code is running on the server, that is, the web
                document If the server makes everything and drops it off, it's
                called server-side rendering.<br />
                If the program code is running in the user's browser, that is,
                When a user puts in a keyword, the content corresponding to this
                keyword is displayed on the server I'm going to get the data,
                and I'm going to get this data, and I'm going to get this data
                on the screen If the code of the application is circulating in
                the browser It's called client rendering.<br />
                Anyway, I'm going to start with the latter version of
                client-side rendering I developed it.<br />
                But how can someone else's program code run on my browser Is
                there? I was curious In JavaScript code, the web browser reads
                the JavaScript code language There is a function to execute.<br />
                So, front-end development uses JavaScript language In summary,
                the default page is the default . html, and the user can select
                the keyword If you put it in, send a request to the server
                (backend), and receive the result data I developed JavaScript to
                recreate the document, and the user When you access my homepage,
                you can access this JavaScript file You drop it on your browser,
                so you can download this JavaScript file from your browser It's
                going to be implemented.<br />
                In the end, it's the front to develop JavaScript code It's the
                end.<br /><br />
                * react><br /><br />
                When developing the front-end, you have to start from scratch
                with JavaScript No, I'm going to use different frameworks and
                libraries, A framework or library is simply:<br />
                I want to make it easier and faster to develop in a certain
                language I think it's a tool that was created, a function that
                can be used.<br />
                So I have to study and understand the basics of JavaScript You
                can do it.<br />
                I study JavaScript, frameworks, and libraries You need to learn
                how to use it. I have to study separately.<br />
                In other words, language studies basic linguistic concepts,
                practices application, Libraries and frameworks are made with
                concepts and usage. If you learn and use them well It is
                possible.<br />
                I think it would be good to practice in a pattern that I use
                often.<br />
                So, when you do client-side rendering for reactants, it's a
                little bit different for the user Expect faster rendering,<br />
                It makes it easier for developers to develop the front end It's
                a JavaScript library, and I made it on Facebook.<br />
                I worked on the react, and the first one was this HTML marked up
                Files have been made into react components.<br /><br />
                * Components > <br /><br />
                If you look at the HTML document, the component is a single file
                with one whole file However,<br />
                In React, I divide all of these into components and manage them
                It brings up the components, but this split unit is I don't
                think so For example, if you make one of these boxes into one
                component If you look at the page, this component is sprayed
                repeatedly.<br />
                As a result, the data that goes into this component is different
                I'm putting it in.<br /><br />
                * Routing ><br /><br />
                And if you look at the results of the markup, this index. html
                and list. html File actually exists,<br />
                Press this tag button to go to list. html I hung it up a
                href="./list. html" However, most web apps made with front-end
                development It doesn't work like this.<br />
                I told you earlier, not to link it to an actual HTML fileShippy
                Because it's making the screen dynamic, the user can move to
                this url Then, I made a screen that fits this url and made it
                render.<br />
                For example, if you go to Dave/Bulletin/profile, you can get a
                screen that fits this url I made it to render it.<br />
                This is called a single page application (SPA) method Make the
                urls you need.<br />
                ("/")<br />
                ("/Board/Name")<br />
                ("/Board/content/content-id")<br />
                ("/admin")<br />
                And... Connecting pages that fit this url is called routing I am
                doing.<br />
                / ->Main page "/"
                <br />
                /Bulletin Board/Tag Name -> List Page<br />
                /Bulletin board/content/contentid -> Detailed page <br />
                /admin->Admin Manager<br />
                Other... -> 404 Error<br />
                So the routing went well, but the result was still a fixed
                screen, Whatever you press, the content comes out the same.
                <br />
                The reason is that when I create these components, I temporarily
                use these data I made a temporary page with a temporary title
                and a temporary explanation It's because it's in a state of
                condition, but in reality, it doesn't have the data that fits
                your request I'll have to get it and put it in then. <br />
                So where do I get this data? <br />
                (I think it's a good idea to play that role It's a back-end
                server) <br />
                So, where are these data?
                <br />
                (That storage space is the database)
              </p>

              <h4>4. Backend Part</h4>
              <p>
                *Modeling Usually, when a plan comes out, DB modeling is done
                first It's said that, <br />
                In other words, I design what schemas I'm going to make, In my
                case, when I came up with this function, <br />
                That is, when you go into the page, you'll see the latest
                update, and you'll see what happens Click to show the details,
                press the tag to match the tag I'll show you the list. <br />
                When I came up with this function, I thought I should make a
                schema like this First, DB modeling and development. <br />
                If you look closely, it looks like this. (Title, description,
                image, tag, url) Like this It is called modeling that consists
                of units (in apps) that are used a lot.<br />
                I named this model Content. This model is one of a kind To
                become an object, I need to get data from DB and put it in The
                data are in the DB like this, <br />
                The concept may differ depending on whether it is RDB, nosql, or
                DBMS, To put it simply, DB also created this schema called
                contents, The 1:1 mapping of the DB schema and the model in the
                app It's common, but it may not be. <br />
                The slide board area here, the image below, the link, and so on
                I'm using the same schema, but I'm showing you a different
                version of css it is. In other words, most of the areas that I'm
                showing on my page I'm taking the data from the DB and
                distributing it to them. *API is just a concept, And justice.
                <br />
                So I make API and use it. I don't make something and use it
                There's an API concept, but it's not just a code, a program, or
                anything It's a program that's designed and made. <br />
                So, the program that connects a specific program and a program
                It's an API. I have to make it. <br />
                And it's kind of like a messenger, and it's like a point of
                contact Connecting parts / Meggaeche Everything that connects is
                an API Rest API is an API for exchanging data, and API is a
                client -> API request -> Server (DB) -> API response -> Client ~
                Like this Make a move. <br />
                So, API is the connection (connecting and receiving) function If
                it's a Maegette program, and that's the API of Naver's login
                function, it's literally If you have to log in to a particular
                homepage and you have to go back to that site, you can connect
                it I used Naver login API to connect it, so literally It's an
                API. <br />
                Through the API... So how do I get the data from the front end
                Should I bring it? <br />
                Since there's data in the DB, I need to access the DB It's not
                like I'm developing direct access to the DB and extracting data
                I don't. <br />
                There's a backend server in the middle of the web page and the
                DB, and there's data I'm asking you to give it to me. For
                example, on this page, the user is going to say If you pressed
                the tag,<br />
                In this front-end chord, you have to route it like this To
                enable dave.io/ bulletin/mail to show the page that fits the
                route Rendering again. <br />
                But when you render it like this, you put in a list that fits
                the tag I need to render it , So before I render it I asked the
                backend server to give me content that fits this tag I am
                doing.<br />
                The back-end server is always on standby, and when I get a
                request like this, I get it and return the result. <br />
                This is the request If you put it in, the interface that
                responds to the results is called API I am doing. <br />
                The API that I'm using now, if you put a tag in it, the content
                that fits that tag It was an API that responded to the list, and
                <br />
                For example, you received the tag mail as a parameter Tag: mail
                Then, the contents that match the keyword 'mail' in DB And I'm
                going to have to get these data back. (i.e., DB -> backend
                server) -> (Client screen) Attach it to DB like this, put data
                in, and print it It's one of the important things that a backend
                server does. <br />
                So the backend server is in the position of providing API, and
                through this API The person making the request is a front-end
                developer or other server developer It's that. <br />
                In the case of open APIs on large platforms like Facebook If you
                make it, people who need it come and use it according to the
                standard ,<br />
                But if you create the same service, the developers can use the
                API that they need After discussing it, I define all the
                specifications and develop them.<br />
                For me, I also work on music In other words, I finished working
                on the react components and routing I made the right page render
                well, and <br />
                So I had to work on spraying the right amount of data To get the
                data, I need to request an API, so I need to get the API of the
                backend I'm moved on to the development stage.
                <br /><br />
                *REST API ><br /><br />
                Then let's see what API you need, <br />
                First of all, the API that gets content when you click on the
                link, where you get specific content If you choose, the API that
                receives information from this content, and the content If you
                write a new one, the API that puts it in the DB, and the
                modification of it Then, the API that reflects the modification
                in the DB, and the content is deleted API, there are other APIs
                used, but <br />
                I'll talk about these first. <br />
                If you are asked to do something with this model (data),<br />
                Create a new model (data) for this,<br />
                Give me several of this model (data),<br />
                Give me one specific model (data) (Inquiry), <br />
                Modify it (modify), delete it, and basically the API doesn't
                know which model to use CRUD is often requested. <br />
                (CRUD is create / read / update / delete) <br />
                So when designing API with API path and http method A lot.
                <br />
                What that means is that the front end is when the user moves to
                a particular url, I had to render a screen that fits the
                dave/bulletin/mail graph,
                <br />
                It's called routing, but the backend doesn't have an API request
                to a particular uri If you come in, you can do the right thing
                and return the results will be routed to execute.<br />
                For example, ID =1 The API's uri that brings content with ID
                number 1 If you set this as content/1, <br />
                So when the backend server gets a request, the uri If you come
                in like this, <br />
                The method of picking content that fits the ID from the DB and
                returning it I made it work. <br />
                And when you return the result value, you usually send it in a
                fixed format.<br />
                This is called the json format, and even the backend of the
                moulin has an HTML document I can make it and drop it off.
                <br />But I don't know how to make it Because the front end code
                is responsible for the view, the server is It's not necessary,
                it's just dropping the data It looks like this, but it's the
                same model you need at the front end, I said it earlierI matched
                the model used in the app with the Sipi DB schema That's why,
                <br />If I were to route the API that I mentioned earlier It
                goes like this. <br />In this way, combine uri and http method
                Therefore, the method of designing an API is called REST API.
                <br />
                So Just by looking at the API specification (spec), you can
                predict what function it will be That's what they do, and that's
                how they're designed most of them are designed.
                <br /><br />*Framework ><br /><br />
                When developing a selection backend, most of them use a web
                framework to develop The language that runs on the browser is
                JavaScript Because of that,<br />
                You can choose which framework to use in JavaScript language
                There was, but the backend has a variety of technology
                stacks.<br />
                Once you choose which language you want to develop, the web that
                fits that language Since there are several frameworks, the
                choice is too wide There are a lot of different things, but the
                frameworks for creating these web apps You can easily create the
                REST API that you mentioned,<br />
                Also, there are functions that simply match DB and model.<br />
                So when I was developing the backend, I was thinking about which
                language and which language I thought about using a framework,
                but option number one is Python Language, should I try Django or
                flask this time? That's what I thought I did it, and I think
                node is the trend for option two, so I'll try it I guess so? The
                node is, as I've been saying, JavaScript It's a language that
                originally runs on the browser.<br />
                Nodejs is not on the browser, but on the server as well It's a
                framework that allows you to go back. <br />
                and There are several node-based frameworks While I was thinking
                about it, <br />NextJS simple on YouTube.It's developed as JS An
                example was given, and in my case, I was able to implement
                server-side rendering I had to do it. I've never done it before,
                so I didn't have a clue in the lecture Since you did everything,
                I'll just copy it I've been through a lot of trouble I didn't
                want to do it. I just follow what's good.<br />
                I have a short temper, so I just want to get the results
                quickly.<br /><br />
                Anyway, to summarize, the framework <br />Next.js I used to
                create a backend server (Express.js embedded server), <br />So I
                made necessary APIs. <br />The APIs are REST where I put my
                contents that will be distributed at the front end in my DB It's
                an API, and it's not an API that does CRUD on my DB, I made API
                requests to external servers.<br />
                For example, bring pictures to my blog here, <br />
                or OAuth for administrative authentication, or external-linked
                APIs like this I was able to make it simple. <br />next.js
                framework, this is What's really good is that the UI uses react
                and has an express server That's it. <br />So server rendering
                works, so the server If you need something, you can stick it on
                It's a feeling, and <br />Other than that, it's a simple thing
                that you've been lazy about It was like a framework. <br />
                Anyway, so From the front end's perspective, the API of the back
                end has been completed I can get the actual data, not the dummy
                data. <br />So you need storage and DB. <br />
                As for the homepage, it's on the vercel right now. MongoDB I
                applied and used it, and I found a free space in the vercel I
                used it.<br />
                Anyway, I only upload my contents there, so there are only a
                few,, I want to use AWS next time.<br />
                To briefly explain the structure of mongoDB, the database is
                just one thing It's a project. A collection is a folder.
                <br />Then why is the folder You need to create a folder.
                MongoDB uses object data types to create data I can put it in.
                <br />Name: David Age:20 Then, exactly Mongodb, it made a
                collection, <br />Create several documents in the folder, and
                the contents of the document, Name: David Age: 20 This is it.
                <br />i.e., several in the collection It is a method of making a
                document (object data type). The collection is a folder, A
                document is a notepad file.

              <h4>Summary</h4>
              <p>
                Took YouTube, Web classes, and create a portfolio That's it The
                client, that is, the code to return from the user's browser
                development.<br />
                The backend is my server, which is managed by the developer, and
                accessed only by the developer You can think of it as developing
                a code to go back to, for example, The front end makes this
                screen, and the server gives you the item information You bring
                it, and you combine the images as the user presses it. These
                codes It's going to go back, and the back end will have a lot of
                things inside, Here, I only talk about API server and DB server,
                and there are items in DB I have various information and send it
                to you when there is a request from outside, This exchange The
                interface is called the API, which is used by the server It
                provides, and <br />So among the ways that API is designed The
                method used is REST API. <br />I want to make ssr a little
                simpler I wanted to do it, and I was actually looking for
                something simpler than redux Googling introduced Next.js.
                <br />Listen to the lecture and study a little bit, When I
                tested it, it really made the service rendering simple.

              <h4>Issues & Troubleshooting</h4>
              <p>
                Issue_1><br />
                -If you need to write code without thinking and js grammar,<br />
                Remove back to the client component, and then to the
                <br />server component There were many cases of importing.
                <br /><br />
                Solution> <br />
                -In Nextjs, there are two component types, <br />
                component <br />2. client component number 1 is a server
                component It's not a big deal. It's just a regular component It
                is a server component. <br />But, write "use client" at the top
                and then at the bottom When you create a component, it's a
                client component. <br />
                The difference is, The server component is in HTML, that is, in
                the return part!! Insert JavaScript functionality It's
                impossible. <br />That is, I will use the html tag on the render
                (return part) OnClick, like this, JavaScript code It's
                impossible.<br />
                UseState, useEffect, etc. are not available. <br />
                But "use client" That is, the client component may use js for
                the return portion. <br />js You can write all the code,
                dynamically all the js. <br />For your information, Server
                components load very fast. (Because there is no js code, I don't
                have to send the js file to the user.) <br />The client
                component is The loading speed may be slower than the server
                component. js file with dozens of keys I'm going. <br />And
                next.js is a process called hydration You have to go through it.
                Hydration is needed. <br />i.e. each component In order to write
                react grammar, you can write HTML on the page to the user After
                transmitting, some time is needed to analyze the html as a
                react.<br />
                The task of analyzing is called hydration.<br />
                By the end of the analysis, the HTML loading time is a little
                slow.
                <br />Because of such advantages and disadvantages, usually
                large pages, It's better to make it into a server component.
                <br />In the big page, the features The parts you need,
                <br />For example, the shopping cart page is a server component
                Create a new server in the <br />Server component (on the
                shopping cart page), <br />For the shopping basket item
                function, go to the <br />Client component page Make it
                <br />CartItem / CartItem / CartItem / Like this, You can import
                it and put it in. <br />Components, because of the large number
                of components It also splits the code. <br />If you squeeze it
                long on one page, It's hard to see, that is, it's hard to read,
                so I'll make another file.<br />
                You write the code on it, you take the code, and you do it I'm
                writing it.(Code Split) <br />example> data.js in cart folder
                Create (side-by-side with page.js), <br />Data or variable
                functions in this file Save your back. <br />Then take data.js
                from page.js and It's like writing. You can import it and use
                it.
              </p>

              <p>
                <br /><br />Issue_2><br /><br />-Deliver data to the component
                Method <br /><br />Solution> <br /><br />
                -Props is usually used to transfer data to the component, but
                the props is a function of It is the same concept as the
                parameter. <br />Parent component is child Props is used to send
                data to components. <br />in reverse direction A child can't
                give data to a parent. <br />Unconditional go from top to
                bottom. <br />
                And it's not a parent-child relationship at all It is also
                impossible to transmit (share) data to components in other
                folders.<br />
                It is always possible to transfer data from parent to child.
                That's why it's the best You have to ride data from the parent
                component and do it like this.
                <br />That's how they send it down.<br />Anyway, it's
                uncomfortable. <br />Then, after each component, when you load
                all of the components It's working, right?If so, it is
                inefficient in react. <br />Because DB sends data to components
                The transmission is the exchange of data, and it's all running,
                so the reading continues When it happens, it slows down again,
                and costs and speeds continue to be wasted If there is, minimal
                communication is fine. <br />But in Nextjs, There may be
                exceptions. <br />For each component, daily It may be okay to
                get data directly from the DB. <br />that is, You don't have to
                use a prop, you don't have to use a parent-child prop It's the
                sound. <br />Because, in fact, Nextjs, you have DB data When
                writing, use <br />fetch(/shopping basket) (usually fetch() for
                DB data Import.) If you request using grammar that requests
                data, <br />Compress it into one, make a request into one, once
                Make a request and make a request. <br />
                Save, operate efficiently It's working. <br />i.e. per
                component, without the need to share data, The code that the DB
                requests and imports directly from the data There must be a lot.
                <br />
                100 requests to the DB server I'm not sending it, but
                <br />Nextjs will compress it and make it efficient, I'll gather
                them at the very least request, communicate with DB, send and
                receive data I mean, I do. <br />Anyway, yes. That's the
                deduplication It's called a function, and if you have multiple
                data requests like <br />, you can use one It compresses it. So,
                even if you use it like that, the problem is There are many
                cases where there is no. <br />props is a function that allows
                you to achieve the same function every time If you want to run
                it differently every time, not every time, parameters It's like
                using grammar. It's good when that happens. <br />Components for
                different purposes each time If you want to make it, you can use
                the props grammar. <br />with similar content There is no need
                to make multiple components. I can use the prop. <br />And for
                your information, the tip for writing the map over and over
                again is, <br />const cards = ["Lotte Card," "Hyundai Card,"
                "Samsung Card"]; <br />Cards like this[0] cards[1] cards[2] This
                is how you don't use it.<br />
                const cardLists = cards.map(v => { return p>{v}an interest-free
                event Medium/p; }); Create a function like this, and write
                <br />{cardLists} like this. You can send this to the props or
                something like this.<br />
                const Banner = props => { const cards = props.cards; const
                cardLists = cards.map((v, i) => { return h5 key={i}>{v}Payment
                í–‰ì‚¬ì¤‘/h5; }); return >{cardLists}/>; }; export default Banner;
                Like this,<br />
                Save it as a prop variable, turn it to <br />map, and put the
                key value, Return and export, go to the parent component,
                component You can insert it. <br />
                For reference, DB data, in the form of an array, const
                shoppingBag = [ { foods: "Tomatoes", costs: 30, count: 1, }, {
                foods: "Pasta", costs: 50, count: 2, }, { foods: "Coconut",
                costs: 80, count: 4, }, ]; for this type of data, in the <br />
                array, objects It's a structure. First of all, CartItem
                items={shoppingBag} / Like this On the child page that was
                loaded into the props and sent to the props, <br />const
                shoppingBagItem = props.items.map((v, i) => { return ( div
                key={i} className='cart-item' p{v.foods}/p p{v.costs}$/p
                p{v.count}pdiv);}); <br />Like this, turn to map and If you take
                an object out of it, v.foods, and so on, it repeats as much as
                the content It is produced.

                <br /><br />Issue_3><br /><br />
                An error appears when using 'use client'. <br />error -
                SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 at
                JSON.parse (anonymous) <br /><br />
                Solution><br /><br />
                Solution: Googling results, <br />
                The reason for the error is "use" in a Windows environment with
                versions less than next.js 13.3.1 When implementing a client
                component using "client", as a general function Implementing a
                functional component results in the corresponding error (bug in
                next.js) Viewed <br />
                The workaround is that the bug can be found in the next.js
                13.3.1-canary.4 version It's settled. <br />
                If you are using an earlier version, when implementing client
                components, the corresponding Arrows the components instead of
                functional components with general functions Implement as a
                functional component using a function and as an export default
                Exporting resolves the error.
